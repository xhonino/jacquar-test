## Phrasee Full Stack Engineer Offline Technical test

### Description
You are tasked with writing an algorithm that takes a feed of notifications and aggregates them. The algorithm should be packaged in a web server that exposes at least one endpoint, and a UI that consumes that endpoint(s).

The notification feed is from a hypothetical social website that allows users to write posts, like posts and comment on posts. The notifications can be of two types: Like and Comment. Like indicates that one user liked a user's post and Comment indicates that one user commented on a user's post.

The notifications should at minimum be aggregated per type and post, you'll be provided with a file containing a JSON of the notifications feed and another file showing how the notifications are expected to be aggregated. Please note that the order in which the notifications are served or aggregated is irrelevant.

You are free to choose any technologies you wish to use to fulfil this task. We only ask that it is functional on a local machine.

### Evaluation

Your submission will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

1.  Correctness: the application should correctly retrieve data from the API, extract the required information, and display it in the UI
2.  Design: the application should be designed using best practices and should be testable.
3.  Readability: the code should be well-organized and easy to read.
4.  Efficiency: the application should be efficient in terms of memory and CPU usage.
5.  Documentation: the code should be adequately documented, with comments where necessary.

### Submission

Please submit your code in a zip file or a GitHub repository that is as close to production ready as possible. The code should include a README file with instructions on how to run the application and any other relevant information.
